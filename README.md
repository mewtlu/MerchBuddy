# MerchBuddy
## Introduction

The intention of this project is to provide some simple features to assist in the upload to and usage of Amazon Merch (merch.amazon.com).

## Features
### Current:
  * During the "Add Details" upload phase text input boxes feature a character count, allowing you to make the most of your available characters.
### To-Do:
  * Add a synonym suggester, possibly using the Big Huge Labs Big Huge Thesaurus API (http://words.bighugelabs.com/api.php).
  * Ability to set default colours and fit types, which are then automatically selected.
  * Ability to set default values for "Brand name", "Title of product", "List Price", both "Key product features" inputs, and "Product description".
