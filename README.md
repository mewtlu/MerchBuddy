#MerchBuddy

##Introduction

The intention of this project is to provide some simple features to assist in the upload to and usage of Amazon Merch (merch.amazon.com).
Currently the only available format is as a Chrome extension.

##Features

###Current:

  * During the "Add Details" upload phase, text input boxes feature a character count, allowing you to make the most of your available characters.
  
###To-Do:

  * Add a synonym suggester, possibly using the Big Huge Labs Big Huge Thesaurus API (http://words.bighugelabs.com/api.php).
  * Ability to set default colours and fit types, which are then automatically selected.
  * Ability to set default values for "Brand name", "Title of product", "List Price", both "Key product features" inputs, and "Product description".
